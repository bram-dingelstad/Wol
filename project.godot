config/name="Wol"
config/description="Wol is a tool for creating interactive dialogue for games. Its based on YarnSpinner and it's Yarn language. 

Write your conversations in Yarn, a simple programming language that's designed to be easy for writers to learn, while also powerful enough to handle whatever you need.

Yarn's similar in style to Twine, so if you already know that, you'll be right at home! If you don't, that's cool - Yarn's syntax is extremely minimal, and there's not much there to learn.

Wol is actively maintained by Bram Dingelstad, if you need a programmer or designer for your next (Godot) project, you can hire him!"
