<p align="center" style="font-style: italic"> The friendly tool for writing game dialogue, in and for Godot</p>
</p> 

---

**Wol** is a tool for creating interactive dialogue for games. Its based on [YarnSpinner](https://yarnspinner.dev/) and it's Yarn language. 

Write your conversations in *Yarn*, a simple programming language that's designed to be easy for writers to learn, while also powerful enough to handle whatever you need. 

Yarn's similar in style to [Twine](http://twinery.org), so if you already know that, you'll be right at home! If you don't, that's cool - Yarn's syntax is extremely minimal, and there's not much there to learn. 

## Getting Started

This repo contains the source code for the Wol compiler. If you want to use it in a game engine other than Godot, you should get the appropriate package for your game engine.

* ~**Download Wol in Godot's AssetLib**~ (not available yet)
* **[Yarn Spinner for Unity](https://github.com/YarnSpinnerTool/YarnSpinner-Unity/releases/latest)** (2018.4 LTS or later)

Once you've downloaded it, head over to the ~[tutorial](#)~! (Currently under construction)

## Roadmap

There are few things that need to be ironed out to be 100% feature compatible with the original YarnSpinner.

- [ ] Integration with Godot's translation/localization system.
- [ ] Full support for [format functions](https://yarnspinner.dev/docs/syntax/#format-functions).
- [ ] In-editor dialogue editor with preview.
- [x] Porting to usable signals in Godot.
- [x] Providing helpful errors when failing to compile.

## License

Wol is available under the [MIT License](LICENSE.md). This means that you can use it in any commercial or noncommercial project. The only requirement is that you need to include attribution in your game's docs. A credit would be very, very nice, too, but isn't required. If you'd like to know more about what this license lets you do, tldrlegal.com have a [very nice write up about the MIT license](https://tldrlegal.com/license/mit-license) that you might find useful.
